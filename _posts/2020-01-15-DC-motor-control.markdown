The client, written in MATLAB, communicates with the PIC32 on the NU32 development board via serial port, sending control gains and desired setpoints and motion trajectories, and tracking results are sent back to the MATLAB client for plotting. The PIC32 manages a nested control loop system consisting of a PID outer motion control loop and a high-speed PI inner current (torque) control loop:
