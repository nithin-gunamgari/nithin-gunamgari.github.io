NVIDIA Flownet:

- End to End Machine Learning Model to Track Optical Flow.

- Combines several datasets from SINTEL, an Optical Flow Dataset from a 3D Animated Film, to Flying Chairs which has 3D chair models superimposed on random pictures.

- Comes in Many Different Versions with Different Speeds and Capabilities.

Flownet S:

- Input: two stacked images ([image(t), image(t-1)]).

- Encode: 9 Convolutional layers (strides: 2) 
                 ○ conv 7*7: 1 layers 
                 ○ conv 5*5: 2 layers 
                 ○ conv 3*3: 6 layers

- Decode: Refinement layers 


Flownet C:

- FlowNet C first produce representations of the two images separately, 

- Combines them together in the ‘correlation layer’, and learn the higher representation together.

Flownet 2:

- FLownet 2 is a small and simple deep network (Fusion) to fuse the output of FlowNet 2-CSS and FlowNet 2-SD.

- FlowNet 2-SD is a little different than FlowNet S. They replaced the 7*7 and 5*5 kernels in the beginning with multiple 3*3 kernels, and removed the stride 2 in the first layer.

- FlowNet 2-CSS is combination of FLownet C and two FlowNet S. 

| Description  | FlowNet C  | FlowNet 2  |
|---|---|---|
| Average End point error  | 4.31  | 2.02  |
| Runtime in millisecond per frame (GPU)  | 32  | 123  |
